0.4.0 / 2013-04-16
==================

  * readme updated
  * Added pasteSelection-slot and corrected two nonsense comments
  * qt/embedded doesn't ship with a Monospace font (and it won't use system fonts even if they exist). Using 'fixed' instead works fine
  * Without this, the terminal display area will permanently lose focus when consoleq's Find dialog is called up.
  * This is only needed when using Qt/E built for DirectFB display. DirectFB blocks SIGINT and some other signals, so any terminal app (be it Qt or otherwise) must call sigprocmask() to unblock them. Without this, ^C doesn't work.
  * The control and tab keys don't work in Qt/E. This fixes it, but maybe not in the most elegant way. The trouble seems to be that _codec->fromUnicode(event->text()) doesn't handle control characters in qt-embedded.
  * Fix resize label
  * Search code cleanup
  * Change searchbar background color to red(ish) when no match found
  * Fix search, find-next when selection is one character long
  * Hotkeys for search: Return->find-next, Shift-Return->find-previous, Escape->hide searchbar
  * Added search functionality

  * fix for text drawing in qt>=4.8,x
  * constructor for Qt Designer
  * test commit
  * clear() slot implemented
  * fix the scroll at the end again
  * The escape key is always needed for terminal programs like vim.
  * Add resource files and the appropriate paths to enable bundling of color schemes and keyboard layouts into the actual executable.
  * Add a define which will be used to bundle the color schemes and keyboard layouts as resource files with the executable itself instead of putting them on disk.
  * scrollToEnd() method provided to trigger 'snapping' the terminal to cursor tracked position (typically the extreme value of the scrollbar, or the 'end') Some signal-fu particular to keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent *) done to make the above usable, no existing dependent implementations should be disturbed by this.
  * revert workaround for key on end
  * scroll to bottom on input
  * scrollToEnd() method provided to trigger 'snapping' the terminal to cursor tracked position (typically the extreme value of the scrollbar, or the 'end') Some signal-fu particular to keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent *) done to make the above usable, no existing dependent implementations should be disturbed by this.
