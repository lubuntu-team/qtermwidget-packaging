### Compiling sources

The only runtime dependency is qtbase ≥ 5.6.
In order to build CMake ≥ 3.0.2 and [lxqt-build-tools](https://github.com/lxde/lxqt-build-tools/) >= 0.3 are needed as well as Git to pull translations and optionally latest VCS checkouts.

Code configuration is handled by CMake. CMake variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` will normally have to be set to `/usr`, depending on the way library paths are dealt with on 64bit systems variables like `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` may have to be set as well.

To build run `make`, to install `make install` which accepts variable `DESTDIR` as usual.
